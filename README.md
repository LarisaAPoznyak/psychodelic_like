## ✨ Project Overview

This project explores whether virtual reality (VR) environments based on **hyperbolic** and **fractal geometry** can evoke **psychedelic-like experiences**—both subjectively and physiologically—without the use of psychoactive substances.

Participants were immersed in geometric VR scenes while their **EEG**, **cardiac**, and **electrodermal** responses were recorded. The goal: investigate changes in **alpha power**, **Lempel-Ziv complexity**, and **autonomic responses**.

---

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

- **Participants:** 30 healthy right-handed individuals (18–35 years)
- **Stimuli:** 20 VR scenes created in Unity & Blender:
  - 🌀 *Hyperbolic Honeycombs* (non-Euclidean)
  - 🔁 *Fractals* (self-similar patterns)
  - 🧊 *Euclidean Cubes* (control)
  - 🔮 *Kaleidoscopes* (control)
- **Devices:** Meta Quest 2 VR headset, 28-channel EEG, ECG, and EDA sensors
- **Measures:**
  - EEG spectral power (delta, theta, alpha, beta)
  - Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc)
  - Heart rate & EDA
  - MEQ-30 questionnaire

## 📊 Key Findings

| Measure              | Hyperbolic vs. Control Cubes           | Fractals vs. Kaleidoscopes           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Alpha Power (EEG)**| 🔻 Decreased (suggests psychedelic state)| No significant change               |
| **LZ Complexity**    | 🔺 Higher in control (unexpected)        | No significant difference            |
| **Heart Rate**       | 🔺 Increased under hyperbolic scenes     | No significant effect                |
| **EDA**              | ❌ No significant differences            | ❌ No significant differences         |
| **Self-Reports**     | Honeycombs rated more complex           | Fractals ≈ Kaleidoscopes in ratings  |

*Hyperbolic geometry allows more than 6 edges to meet at a single vertex.*

## 🧠 Interpretation

- Decrease in alpha rhythm under hyperbolic VR mirrors psychedelic-like neural states.
- No increase in entropy (LZc) suggests cognitive load or sensory complexity, not full psychedelic replication.
- Qualitative responses suggest meditative and altered perceptions but not full mystical states.

---

## 🔍 Hypothesis Evaluation

✅ **H1:** Subjective complexity ↑ in honeycombs  
✅ **H2 (partial):** Alpha ↓, LZc unexpectedly higher in control  
✅ **H3 (partial):** Heart rate ↑, but EDA unchanged  

---

## 🧬 Implications

- **VR can partially simulate psychedelic states** using geometry alone.
- Offers a **non-pharmacological pathway** for exploring altered states—potentially safer and more accessible.
- Can inform **psychiatric therapies**, creativity research, and consciousness studies.
