## ✨ Project Overview

This project explores whether virtual reality (VR) environments based on **hyperbolic** and **fractal geometry** can evoke **psychedelic-like experiences**—both subjectively and physiologically—without the use of psychoactive substances.

Participants were immersed in geometric VR scenes while their **EEG**, **cardiac**, and **electrodermal** responses were recorded. The goal: investigate changes in **alpha power**, **Lempel-Ziv complexity**, and **autonomic responses**.

---

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

- **Participants:** 30 healthy right-handed individuals (18–35 years)
- **Stimuli:** 20 VR scenes created in Unity & Blender:
  - 🌀 *Hyperbolic Honeycombs* (non-Euclidean)
  - 🔁 *Fractals* (self-similar patterns)
  - 🧊 *Euclidean Cubes* (control)
  - 🔮 *Kaleidoscopes* (control)
- **Devices:** Meta Quest 2 VR headset, 28-channel EEG, ECG, and EDA sensors
- **Measures:**
  - EEG spectral power (delta, theta, alpha, beta)
  - Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc)
  - Heart rate & EDA
  - MEQ-30 questionnaire

## 📊 Key Findings

| Measure              | Hyperbolic vs. Control Cubes           | Fractals vs. Kaleidoscopes           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Alpha Power (EEG)**| 🔻 Decreased (suggests psychedelic state)| No significant change               |
| **LZ Complexity**    |  No significant difference      | No significant difference            |
| **Heart Rate**       | 🔺 Increased under hyperbolic scenes     | No significant effect                |
| **EDA**              | ❌ No significant differences            | ❌ No significant differences         |
| **Self-Reports**     | Honeycombs rated more complex           | Fractals ≈ Kaleidoscopes in ratings  |

## 🎨 Visual Examples

![Sample VR Scene: Hyperbolic Honeycomb](./images/honeycomb_sample.png)  
*Hyperbolic geometry allows more than 6 edges to meet at a single vertex.*

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

- Decrease in alpha rhythm under hyperbolic VR mirrors psychedelic-like neural states.
- No increase in entropy (LZc) suggests cognitive load or sensory complexity, not full psychedelic replication.
- Qualitative responses suggest meditative and altered perceptions but not full mystical states.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores the **psychophysiological and neural effects** of *non-Euclidean* and *fractal* geometries in virtual reality (VR).

It provides:
- **20 custom VR scenes**, divided into:
  - 🌀 *Test (psychedelic-like)*: hyperbolic & fractal
  - 🔲 *Control*: Euclidean cubes & kaleidoscopic patterns
- Complete codebase for analyzing:
  - 📊 EEG recordings
  - ❤️‍🔥 Heart rate & electrodermal activity
  - 🧠 Subjective reports

---

## 📐 Hypotheses

**H1**: A whole VR session (including psychedelic-like and control scenes) will induce a *mystical experience*.

**H2**: Compared to controls, psychedelic-like VR (hyperbolic, fractal) will:
- 🔻 Reduce alpha power
- 🔺 Increase neural complexity (LZc)

**H3**: Psychedelic-like VR increases **physiological arousal** (heart rate, EDA).

## 📊 Summary of Key Results

| Measure                         | Hyperbolic vs. Control Cubes               | Fractals vs. Kaleidoscopes            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Alpha Power (EEG)**           | 🔻 Decreased (psychedelic-like signature)  | ❌ No significant effect               |
| **LZ Complexity (LZc)**         | ❌ No significant differences  | ❌ No significant difference          |
| **Heart Rate**                  | 🔺 Increased                                | ❌ No significant difference           |
| **EDA**                         | ❌ No significant differences               | ❌ No significant differences          |
| **Subjective Scene Complexity** | 🧠 Hyperbolic scenes rated more complex     | 🤷‍♀️ Fractals & Kaleidoscopes rated similarly |

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

- **Alpha Power ↓** in hyperbolic scenes reflects a *psychedelic-like state*, but might also stem from increased cognitive processing demands.
- **Heart Rate ↑** in hyperbolic conditions suggests increased arousal, consistent with psychedelic physiological effects.

## ✅ Hypothesis Evaluation

### ❌ H1: Not Supported  
The full "mystical experience" threshold was not met. Subjective reports were low in intensity, and MEQ-30's mystical component was excluded.  
> *However, there were weak indications of transcendence or meditative states.*

**OR (Alternative phrasing):**  
### ✅ H1: Partially Supported  
Participants reported *some altered state components* (e.g., time-space distortion), but no full mystical experience—likely due to methodological limits (modified MEQ, short session).

---

### ↔️ H2: Mixed Results
- **Alpha Power**: ✅ Reduced in hyperbolic condition (partial support)  
- **Neural Complexity (LZc)**: ❌ No support

## 🔍 Hypothesis Evaluation

✅ **H1:** Subjective complexity ↑ in honeycombs  
✅ **H2 (partial):** Alpha ↓,  
✅ **H3 (partial):** Heart rate ↑, but EDA unchanged

## 🧬 Implications

- This technology could serve as a non-pharmacological tool for psychiatry, creativity research, and consciousness studies, with potential applications in emotional regulation and well-being.
